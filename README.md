Path Traversal is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when a user can manipulate file paths in an application to access directories and files that are outside the intended directory. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to files or directories stored on the web server, which may contain sensitive data like passwords, configuration files, or other critical information.
